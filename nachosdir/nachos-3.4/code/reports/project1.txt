Exercise 1: Simple Threads Programming 

Before starting to work on exercise one program nachos was run to record the default output. The first change made was on file threadtest.cc to implement the new SimpleThread function.
 From there on the rest was simple. The ThreadTest(int n) was implemented in threadtest.cc file and it was defined in main.cc. The biggest issue was presented when testing exercise one 
since some instructions were a little confusing to me. Finally, I was able to figure it out. The code works correctly.
			
Exercise 2: Implementing Locks:
	
For exercise 2, I implemented changes on synch.cc and synch.h. The struggle was when I had to do implementations modifications on the threadtest.cc in order to make it work. then the 
testing wasn't a problem. The output was correct.         

Exercise 3: Implementing Conditions:

For exercise 3 I hit a roadblock because I forgot some important syntax, but after that the rest was smooth sailing and the code runs with no problems.

Exercise 4:Elevator question: 

With exercise 4 I was able to create an initial code base though I was having trouble with the testing. Because I couldn't test very well, I am not sure if the code runs correctly.
 Whatever I tried I could not get the code to test properly, as I have tried to ise the preprocessor directives with no avail. It would always default to the nachos threadtest code without fail.
